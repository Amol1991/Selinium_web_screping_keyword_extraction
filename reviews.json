[{"body": "Great value for you're money! I can't believe I paid $9 for this!

I read the ingredients on the back of the bottle as compared to the ingredients on the actual Dove website for the same product and they're identical. Not a thing different. This product actually helped soften and clear my skin up! My husband and I have been ordering this same bottle for a year now. My only con is that when water gets inside the bottle it starts to smell like mildew after a little while so I suggest keeping it above and away from where your showerhead sprays or in a cabinet once you're done using it."}, {"body": "I first tried this wash at a relative\u2019s home even though I packed my own soap. My skin is very nice (Praise God), but very sensitive. I have to read ingredients, and do trial runs to ensure that the wash can be tolerated over the long haul. I have had some soaps and washes that started off great but skin would start to reject them. So I forgot to bring my wash to the bathroom and my suitcase was downstairs and I was already undressed.

My husband somehow goes through a bottle of body wash per week, but with this large size bottle, I don't have to change it out as frequently.  For one, the bottle holds a lot of product, and two, the pump dispenses a normal amount of body wash, minimizing the amount my husband uses.  The scent is a fairly neutral 'clean' scent, so we are both fine using this product. This means one less bottle of product taking up real estate in the shower. As for moisturizing, I still need to follow up with lotion, but my skin definitely feels softer right out of the shower."}, {"body": "Buy it! My old body wash (different brand) broke my skin out really bad, like, back covered in pimples and it\u2019s painful. I never had this problem, and I needed a new body wash ASAP. So I ordered this, got it the next day as expected. The smell is amazing, subtle and really nice. It\u2019s foamy, moisturizing, my sensitive skin is already feeling better after the first wash. I highly recommend it, like I feel so clean after one wash, my skin is soft, I highly recommend. Also a huge bottle for only $8.

My skin is very nice (Praise God), but very sensitive. I have to read ingredients, and do trial runs to ensure that the wash can be tolerated over the long haul. I have had some soaps and washes that started off great but skin would start to reject them. So I forgot to bring my wash to the bathroom and my suitcase was downstairs and I was already undressed. Okay! So let\u2019s try this Dove wash and see what happens \u2014 nothing: no irritation, no super dryness, no breakouts for two weeks. Perfect! I decided to purchase it and I am very pleased."}, {"body": "I love this product. My husband somehow goes through a bottle of body wash per week, but with this large size bottle, I don't have to change it out as frequently.  For one, the bottle holds a lot of product, and two, the pump dispenses a normal amount of body wash, minimizing the amount my husband uses.  The scent is a fairly neutral 'clean' scent, so we are both fine using this product. This means one less bottle of product taking up real estate in the shower. As for moisturizing, I still need to follow up with lotion, but my skin definitely feels softer right out of the shower."}, {"body": "Buy it! My old body wash (different brand) broke my skin out really bad, like, back covered in pimples and it\u2019s painful. I never had this problem, and I needed a new body wash ASAP. So I ordered this, got it the next day as expected. The smell is amazing, subtle and really nice. It\u2019s foamy, moisturizing, my sensitive skin is already feeling better after the first wash. I highly recommend it, like I feel so clean after one wash, my skin is soft, I highly recommend. Also a huge bottle for only $8. Totally worth it."}, {"body": "Hola. el producto que recibi no es lo que dice la descripcion puesto que recibi un solo pomo de 34oz y no 4 paquetes de 22 oz como decia la descripcion escojida.

My old body wash (different brand) broke my skin out really bad, like, back covered in pimples and it\u2019s painful. I never had this problem, and I needed a new body wash ASAP.

My old body wash (different brand) broke my skin out really bad, like, back covered in pimples and it\u2019s painful. I never had this problem, and I needed a new body wash ASAP.

My old body wash (different brand) broke my skin out really bad, like, back covered in pimples and it\u2019s painful. I never had this problem, and I needed a new body wash ASAP.

I highly recommend it, like I feel so clean after one wash, my skin is soft, I highly recommend. Also a huge bottle for only $8.

My old body wash (different brand) broke my skin out really bad, like, back covered in pimples and it\u2019s painful. I never had this problem, and I needed a new body wash ASAP.

I highly recommend it, like I feel so clean after one wash, my skin is soft, I highly recommend. Also a huge bottle for only $8.

It's been amazing!"}, {"body": "So I almost didn\u2019t purchase this item because of the reviews and the reviews was wrong I actually looked up the ingredients online on the official dove  website and it\u2019s the same ingredients of the dove  that I got from AmazonAnd this is also sold by the this is not another seller as well so maybe something happened with you guys order but this is the real dove and I love it"}, {"body": "I used to buy the bar soaps but they tend to get a little messy so I opted for the liquid version of it. Truth is that the liquid version is very different from the tried and beloved bar soap as I know it. The smell is not all that good and it\u2019s drying to the skin- at least mine. I tend to wash my hands a lot on any given day and have seriously dry hands because of it. I am yet to find a hand cream that can provide relief after all the hand washing. My high hopes for this supposedly moisturizing liquid soap have been crushed after the first day of using it. I must find something better than this I\u2019m sorry. Because of this reason I cannot give better than the so-so average rating. I wish it was a better quality. Not buying again for sure. Can\u2019t recommend for dry skin / hands. There has to be a better option."}, {"body": "I hate this body wash. I cannot believe how bad it dries out my skin!! Soo bad! After being completely dry, im soo ashy from how much it dried my skin. I hate it, HATE it. I will absolutely NOT be buying again, such a waste of money!"}]
